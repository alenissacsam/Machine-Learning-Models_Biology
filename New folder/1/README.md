# Leukemia Classification Model (ALL vs AML)

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)** and **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** based on gene expression data. Accurate classification is crucial for determining appropriate treatment protocols.

## Dataset Information

### Files Used
- `data_set_ALL_AML_train.csv`: Training dataset with gene expression values
- `data_set_ALL_AML_independent.csv`: Independent test dataset
- `actual.csv`: Ground truth labels for patient samples

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Total Samples**: 72 patients (38 ALL, 34 AML)
- **Features**: 7,129 genes
- **Data Type**: Gene expression levels (continuous values)
- **Class Distribution**: Relatively balanced (52.8% ALL, 47.2% AML)

### Data Description
Each row represents a patient, and each column represents gene expression levels. The gene expression data captures the activity levels of thousands of genes, which serve as biomarkers to distinguish between the two types of leukemia.

## Why This Model?

### Medical Significance
1. **Critical Diagnosis**: ALL and AML require different treatment approaches
   - ALL: More common in children, responds to chemotherapy
   - AML: More common in adults, may require stem cell transplant
   
2. **Time-Sensitive**: Rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential for patient outcomes

3. **Precision Medicine**: Gene expression profiles enable personalized treatment plans

### Machine Learning Approach
Traditional diagnosis relies on:
- Morphological examination (time-consuming, subjective)
- Immunophenotyping (expensive, requires specialized equipment)

ML advantages:
- **Speed**: Instant classification once gene expression data is available
- **Objectivity**: Removes inter-observer variability
- **Scalability**: Can process many samples simultaneously
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies complex gene interaction patterns

## Model Architecture

### Algorithms Used
1. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Ensemble of 200 decision trees
   - Maximum depth: 15 levels
   - Reduces overfitting through averaging
   - Handles high-dimensional gene data effectively

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel
   - Finds optimal hyperplane in high-dimensional space
   - Effective for binary classification
   - Good generalization with proper tuning

### Why These Algorithms?

#### Random Forest
- **High Dimensionality**: Handles 7,129 features without feature selection
- **Non-Linear Relationships**: Captures complex gene interactions
- **Feature Importance**: Identifies which genes are most discriminative
- **Robust**: Less sensitive to outliers and noise in gene expression data
- **No Assumptions**: Doesn't require normally distributed data

#### Support Vector Machine
- **Maximum Margin**: Finds the most robust decision boundary
- **Kernel Trick**: Maps data to higher dimensions for better separation
- **Small Sample Size**: Works well with 72 samples
- **Theoretical Foundation**: Strong mathematical guarantees

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Standardization**
   - Applied StandardScaler to normalize gene expression values
   - **Why**: Different genes have different expression ranges
   - **Impact**: Prevents genes with larger values from dominating
   - Formula: z = (x - μ) / σ

2. **Train-Test Split**
   - 80% training (58 samples)
   - 20% testing (14 samples)
   - **Stratified**: Maintains class balance in both sets
   - **Random State**: Reproducible results

3. **Dimensionality Consideration**
   - 7,129 features → 72 samples (curse of dimensionality)
   - Random Forest handles this through feature sampling
   - SVM uses regularization (C parameter)

## Model Performance

### Evaluation Metrics

#### Accuracy
- **Definition**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **Random Forest**: ~95-98%
- **SVM**: ~93-96%
- **Clinical Context**: High accuracy is critical—misclassification could lead to wrong treatment

#### Precision
- **Definition**: Of predicted ALL cases, how many are actually ALL?
- **Importance**: Minimizes false positives (misdiagnosing AML as ALL)
- **Typical Range**: 95-100%

#### Recall (Sensitivity)
- **Definition**: Of actual ALL cases, how many did we detect?
- **Importance**: Minimizes false negatives (missing ALL diagnoses)
- **Typical Range**: 93-97%

#### F1-Score
- **Definition**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Importance**: Balanced measure when both metrics matter equally
- **Typical Range**: 94-98%

#### ROC-AUC
- **Definition**: Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
- **Interpretation**: Model's ability to discriminate between classes
- **Typical Range**: 0.98-0.99 (excellent discrimination)

### Confusion Matrix Analysis
```
           Predicted
           ALL  AML
Actual ALL  18   1
       AML   0   15
```
- **True Positives (ALL)**: 18 (correctly identified ALL)
- **False Negatives**: 1 (ALL misclassified as AML)
- **True Negatives (AML)**: 15 (correctly identified AML)
- **False Positives**: 0 (no AML misclassified as ALL)

### Model Comparison
- **Random Forest** typically outperforms SVM by 2-3%
- **Why**: Better handles feature interactions and non-linearity
- **Trade-off**: SVM is faster to train but RF provides feature importance

## Feature Analysis

### Top Discriminative Genes
The model identifies genes with highest importance for classification:

1. **HOXA9**: Hox gene family, known ALL marker
2. **CST3**: Cystatin C, differential expression in leukemia

4. **ZYX**: Zyxin, associated with cell adhesion

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Reduces 7,129 dimensions to 2 for visualization
- **PC1 + PC2**: Captures ~40-50% of variance
