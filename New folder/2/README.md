### Why These Algorithms?

#### Random Forest
**Strengths:**
- **Feature Interactions**: Captures complex relationships (e.g., smoking + family history)
- **Robustness**: Averages multiple trees, reduces variance
- **Feature Importance**: Identifies which factors matter most
- **Handles Mixed Data**: Works with numerical and categorical features

- Non-linear relationships (e.g., U-shaped BMI effect)
- Interactions between genetic and environmental factors

#### Gradient Boosting
**Strengths:**
- **High Accuracy**: Sequentially corrects errors
- **Handles Imbalance**: Focuses on hard-to-classify cases
- **Feature Selection**: Naturally emphasizes important variables
- **Smooth Predictions**: Less prone to overfitting than single trees

**Application to Asthma:**
- Captures subtle patterns in clinical measurements
- Balances sensitivity and specificity
- Learns from misclassified cases (borderline asthma)

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Label Encoding**
   - Categorical variables → numerical (0, 1, 2...)
   - Applied to: Gender, Smoking, Air Pollution, Occupation, Allergies
   - Preserves ordinal relationships where applicable

2. **Standardization**
   - StandardScaler applied to all features
   - **Why**: Different scales (Age: 18-80, BMI: 15-40, PEF: 200-600)
   - **Impact**: Equal weight to all features
   - Formula: z = (x - μ) / σ

3. **Train-Test Split**
   - 80% training (8,002 samples)
   - 20% testing (2,000 samples)
   - **Stratified**: Maintains asthma prevalence
   - **Random State**: Reproducibility

4. **Missing Data Handling**
   - Synthetic dataset: No missing values
   - Real-world: Would use imputation or indicator variables
