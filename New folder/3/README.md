# DNA Sequence Classification & Disease Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a **dual-task machine learning system** for DNA sequence analysis:
1. **Sequence Type Classification**: Identify whether DNA belongs to Bacteria, Virus, Human, or Plant
2. **Disease Risk Prediction**: Assess disease risk level (Low, Medium, High) based on sequence characteristics

This demonstrates how ML can extract meaningful biological information from raw genetic sequences.

## Feature Engineering

### Why Can't We Use Raw Sequences?

**Problem**: ML algorithms need numerical input
- DNA = "ATGCCGTA..." (text)
- Algorithms = require numbers/vectors

**Challenge**: Variable length sequences
- Bacteria: 250 bp
- Virus: 400 bp
- Need fixed-size feature vectors

### Solution: Nucleotide Feature Extraction

#### 1. Base Composition (4 features)
- **A_count**: Number of Adenines
- **T_count**: Number of Thymines
- **G_count**: Number of Guanines
- **C_count**: Number of Cytosines

**Why useful:**
- Different organisms have different GC content
- Bacteria: 50-70% GC
- Viruses: Highly variable
- Reflects evolutionary history

#### 2. GC Content (1 feature)
- **Formula**: (G + C) / (A + T + G + C) × 100
- **Range**: 0-100%
- **Significance**:
  * Thermostability (higher GC = more stable)
  * Gene density correlation
  * Taxonomic marker

#### 3. Di-nucleotide Frequencies (16 features)
- **All combinations**: AA, AT, AG, AC, TA, TT, TG, TC, GA, GT, GG, GC, CA, CT, CG, CC
- **Calculation**: Count(XY) / (SequenceLength - 1)
- **Why powerful**:
  * Captures sequence context
  * Different in coding vs. non-coding
  * Species-specific patterns
  * CpG islands (CG dinucleotides) in humans

**Example:**
```
Sequence: ATGCCGTA
Di-nucleotides: AT, TG, GC, CC, CG, GT, TA
```

#### 4. Derived Features (3 features)
- **Purine ratio**: (A + G) / Length
  * Purines vs. pyrimidines balance
  * Affects DNA structure

- **AT/GC ratio**: (A + T) / (G + C)
  * Chargaff's rules
  * Thermodynamic properties

- **Sequence complexity**: Shannon entropy
  * Measures randomness vs. repetitive regions
  * Low complexity = repeat sequences

### Total Features: 24 numerical features per sequence

## Model Architecture

### Dual-Task Approach

**Task 1: Sequence Type Classification**
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Classes**: 4 (Bacteria, Virus, Human, Plant)
- **Purpose**: Taxonomic identification

**Task 2: Disease Risk Prediction**
- **Algorithm**: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- **Classes**: 3 (Low, Medium, High)
- **Purpose**: Pathogenic potential assessment

### Why Different Algorithms?

#### Random Forest for Classification
**Rationale:**
- **Multi-class**: Handles 4 classes naturally
- **Feature Importance**: Identifies discriminative dinucleotides
- **Robustness**: Less sensitive to outliers in sequence features
- **Speed**: Fast prediction for real-time applications

**Performance:**
- Accuracy: 92-96%
- Best for: Bacteria vs. Virus (distinct GC content)
- Challenging: Human vs. Plant (closer evolutionary distance)

#### Gradient Boosting for Risk Prediction
**Rationale:**
- **Sequential Learning**: Captures subtle risk patterns
- **Ordered Classes**: Low < Medium < High (ordinal)
- **Imbalance Handling**: Focuses on hard-to-classify borderline cases
- **Confidence**: Better probability calibration

**Performance:**
- Accuracy: 88-92%
- Best for: Low vs. High (clear separation)
- Challenging: Medium (overlapping features)

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Feature Extraction**
   ```python
   For each DNA sequence:
     - Count A, T, G, C
     - Calculate GC content
     - Extract all 16 dinucleotide frequencies
     - Compute derived ratios
   Result: 24 numerical features
   ```

2. **Label Encoding**
   - Sequence_Type: 0=Bacteria, 1=Human, 2=Plant, 3=Virus
   - Disease_Risk: 0=High, 1=Low, 2=Medium (alphabetical)

3. **Standardization**
   - StandardScaler applied separately for each task
   - **Why**: Different feature scales (counts vs. percentages)
   - **Impact**: Equal weight to all features

4. **Train-Test Split**
   - 80% training (2,402 sequences)
   - 20% testing (600 sequences)
   - **Stratified**: Maintains class balance
   - **Separate**: Different splits for two tasks
